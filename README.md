This is the replication code for my City Journal article, "Yes, Bail Reform Increased Crime." In order to actually execute it, you'll need the supplemental pretrial release data file, which is available [here](https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/stats.htm). On that page, click "pretrial release," and then select "Supplemental Pretrial Release Data File." Execute the script in this repository in the same directory as that file, and you should replicate the estimates from the article.
